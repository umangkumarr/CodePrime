# Longest Consecutive 1s in Binary Representation
Given a number `n`, find length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

### Examples : 
```txt
Input : n = 14
Output : 3
The binary representation of 14 is 1110.

Input : n = 222
Output : 4
The binary representation of 222 is 11011110.
```

### Solution:

<strong>Using Bit Magic: </strong> The idea is based on the concept that if we AND a bit sequence with a shifted version of itself, weâ€™re effectively removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.  


<code>
&nbsp; 11101111   (x)   <br/>
    &amp; 11011110   (x &lt;&lt; 1)  <br/>
    ----------  <br/>
&nbsp; 11001110   (x &amp; (x &lt;&lt; 1))   <br/>
&nbsp;   ^    ^  <br/>
&nbsp;   |    |  <br/>
&nbsp; trailing 1 removed  <br/>
</code>

So the operation x = (x & (x << 1)) reduces length of every sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of x. If we keep doing this operation in a loop, we end up with x = 0. The number of iterations required to reach 0 is actually length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s.

<strong>Time Complexity:</strong>

$log(n)$
